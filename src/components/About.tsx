              <p>
                I hold a Bachelor's degree in Commerce with a specialization in Computer Applications, which laid a strong foundation for my journey into the dynamic world of ERP solutions. I began my career as an ERPNext Functional Consultant, where I gained valuable hands-on experience and deep insights into the ERP landscape.

                With a proven background in ERPNext Implementation, Business Analysis, Project Management, and Consulting, I possess the expertise to deliver comprehensive, high-quality ERP solutions tailored to meet diverse business requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, my focus is on driving business development initiatives across the Retail, Manufacturing, Service, and Healthcare sectors. My goal is to implement robust ERP systems that streamline operations, enhance productivity, and foster sustainable business growth.
              </p>
